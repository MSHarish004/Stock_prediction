## Abstract
Prdecting stock price using SVM
The use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict stock price direction has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of SVM in predicting the direction of stock prices using the Reliance dataset, one of the most traded stocks in the Indian stock market.


The study begins with the preprocessing of the Reliance dataset, including data cleaning and feature engineering. The SVM model is then trained using a set of historical data to learn patterns and trends in the stock prices. The trained model is then tested on a set of validation data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.


The experimental results show that the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 70% in predicting the direction of stock prices, which is a promising result. The study also performs an analysis of the SVM model's feature importance to identify the most relevant features for predicting stock prices.


Overall, the study concludes that SVM is a suitable machine learning technique for predicting the direction of stock prices, and it can be effectively used for trading decisions in the stock market. However, the study also emphasizes the need for caution when making investment decisions based on the predictions made by machine learning models, as they are subject to errors and uncertainties.
## MOTIVATION:

There are several compelling reasons to undertake a project on predicting stock price direction using support vector machines with reliance dataset:


1. Real-world application: This project has a practical application in the stock market, as accurate predictions of stock prices can be used to make informed trading decisions.


2. Learning opportunity: You will have the opportunity to learn about machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, which are essential skills in the field of data science.


3. Data analysis: This project requires data analysis skills to extract meaningful insights from the Reliance dataset and identify patterns and trends in stock prices.


4. Career growth: Projects in data science and machine learning are highly valued by employers and can help you build a strong portfolio that showcases your skills and expertise.


5. Contribution to research: Your project can contribute to the growing body of research on predicting stock prices, and your findings may be useful for future research in this area.


Overall, this project provides a challenging and rewarding opportunity to apply your skills in data science and machine learning to a real-world problem with practical implications.
