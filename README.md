## Abstract
Prdecting stock price using SVM
The use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict stock price direction has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of SVM in predicting the direction of stock prices using the Reliance dataset, one of the most traded stocks in the Indian stock market.


The study begins with the preprocessing of the Reliance dataset, including data cleaning and feature engineering. The SVM model is then trained using a set of historical data to learn patterns and trends in the stock prices. The trained model is then tested on a set of validation data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.


The experimental results show that the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 70% in predicting the direction of stock prices, which is a promising result. The study also performs an analysis of the SVM model's feature importance to identify the most relevant features for predicting stock prices.


Overall, the study concludes that SVM is a suitable machine learning technique for predicting the direction of stock prices, and it can be effectively used for trading decisions in the stock market. However, the study also emphasizes the need for caution when making investment decisions based on the predictions made by machine learning models, as they are subject to errors and uncertainties.
